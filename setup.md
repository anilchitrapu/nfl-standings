NFL Standings Application Setup

Overview

This project is a mobile-friendly, responsive web application designed to display up-to-date NFL standings. Users can view teams grouped by conference, division, and NFL-wide standings. The app features interactive views and a dynamic graphical interface inspired by your attached screenshots. Data will be fetched from an NFL API and rendered dynamically.

Features

Responsive Design: Optimized for mobile-first using modern CSS frameworks like TailwindCSS.
Dynamic Data Updates: Integration with an NFL API to fetch real-time standings.
Interactive Navigation: Clickable sections for NFL-wide, conference, and division views.
Native Sharing: Allows users to share standings via native sharing or clipboard fallback.
Performance-Optimized: Lightweight, leveraging caching and lazy-loading techniques.
Static Logos: Placeholder logos to be uploaded in a future step.

Installation and Setup

1. Clone the Repository
git clone https://github.com/your-repo/nfl-standings.git
cd nfl-standings
2. Install Dependencies
npm install
3. Set Up TailwindCSS
Generate the TailwindCSS configuration file:

npx tailwindcss init
Update the tailwind.config.js to include your content paths:

module.exports = {
  content: [
    "./index.html",
    "./src/**/*.{js,jsx,ts,tsx}",
  ],
  theme: {
    extend: {},
  },
  plugins: [],
};
4. Set Up API Integration
Replace the placeholder API endpoint in src/services/api.js with your NFL API key and URL.
Example function:
import axios from "axios";

export const fetchStandings = async () => {
  try {
    const response = await axios.get("https://api.nfl.com/standings", {
      headers: { "X-API-Key": process.env.NFL_API_KEY },
    });
    return response.data;
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Error fetching standings:", error);
    throw error;
  }
};
5. Run the Development Server
npm run dev
Best Practices for Native Sharing

Use the Web Share API for native sharing:
const shareStandings = async (title, text, url) => {
  if (navigator.share) {
    try {
      await navigator.share({ title, text, url });
      console.log("Standings shared successfully");
    } catch (error) {
      console.error("Error sharing:", error);
    }
  } else {
    // Fallback: copy URL to clipboard
    navigator.clipboard.writeText(url);
    alert("URL copied to clipboard");
  }
};
Attach this functionality to the UI in StandingsTable or Chart components.
Recommendations for Performance

Data Caching: Use React Query or browser storage for caching API responses.
Lazy Loading: Implement lazy-loading for charts and images.
Static Asset Optimization: Compress logos before adding to the public/logos folder.
Accessibility: Use semantic HTML and ARIA attributes.
Deployment

Deploy the application using Vercel for seamless CI/CD integration:

Connect the GitHub repository to Vercel.
Configure environment variables (e.g., NFL_API_KEY).
Deploy directly from the main branch.
Let me know if you'd like adjustments before bringing this into Cursor.
